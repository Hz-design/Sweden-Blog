                       I woke up and made some fried rice with some leftover rice yesterday evening. I went to Alessio's place to help him with cooking,
                       Anna, Alessio and Riccardo where in the appartment. After preparing me and Riccardo went to Fritidsbanken to borrow some free ski's for skiing. 
                       Why is it free? It's a concept were people who don't use their outdoor stuff anymore give it to the company so the company can give those items for free
                       to people who want to use them for a period of time. Last January they had their 10 Year anniversary and their arsenal grew to 10.000 pieces of equipment.
                       While trying on the equipment Riccardo explained me a lot about the differences between the kinds of equipment.

                       After we got the stuff we went home by bus and ate some lunch "Pasta philladelphia at Allesio's place!" great Italian budget pasta because the 
                       cheese is very expensive in Sweden. Butter is also very expensive like €5,00 for 500 grams.

                       Taco Friday started, when I arrived it was super busy and cozy. But there was not much food on the table yet so me, Alessio, and his roommate helped preparing the 
                       ingredients. After we finshed we had a great time and it was super delicious!

                       At 22:00 the photography expidition started, Northenlight chances were sadly gone because it was in the night of 20th of January, not the night of 21th of January. 
                       After packing my stuff I went downstairs and a lot more people wanted to go! So our expidition group were: Me, Annabel, Annika, Alvaro, Mia, Niclas, Riccardo, Jonas, Vincent
                       , Timo and Loretto. Together we went on a hike of 26min from the appartment.

                       After arriving there was a lot of artificial lights, the lake was surrounded by yellow lights. I wanted to go to the middle of the lake because it was much darker there.
                       But nobody was willing to come. When the time hits 23:00 all the lights went out and it was completly dark, Wonderful. Nice to know when the Northen Lights will show up.
                       But after the lights went off we started to get our stuff out and trying to photograph the milky way. I used my Canon RA with the 135mm f/2.0 Samyang + a night filter from Urth.
                       And the results:

                       Couldn't see the Milkyway but a glimpse of the Orion Nebula, excited because I totally didn't expected this. Normally the conditions needed to be much better for it to show up.
                       But sadly my gear wasn't good enough, for example my tripod used to move a lot you can see the movement in the pictures and it would be nice if I had a star tracker so that the camera
                       would turn with the axis of the earth. Afterall a succeeded expidition.

                       Time to go home, -12 celsius freezing cold, everyone was shivering so we were in a hurry to get home, I saw a shortcut through the woods and Riccardo decided to take it because why not,
                       I was scared that we would have to walk 1 meter of snow, it was totally dark but luckely I brought my headlamp and so we could navigate safely through the woods back home.

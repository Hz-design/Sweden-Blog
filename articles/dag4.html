                        I woke up at 09:30 and had 30 minutes of time to get up and get breakfast, after breakfast I went back
                        to my room, tidy up a little bit and went installing some mods for stardewvalley with Demi. For tonight!
                        The Italians messaged the group if people wanted to join on a walk through the forest in the mountain behind 
                        the apartments (Nackstavägen).

                        I messaged Eelco if he wanted to join and we went together with the bus to Nackstavägen, the bus ride was shorter
                        then I expected! When we arrived and gathered me, Eelco, Anna, Alvaro, Alessio, Marie, Niclas and Ricardo. 
                        There is a new person called Ricardo he just arrived Yesterday and is also
                        Italian! we went looking for an entrace to the woods, we couldn't see an entrance but
                        noticed an open path between some trees. So we took the route up! It was very beautiful and silent. You could only hear
                        the snow cracking when stepping on it. But soon enough the snow got deeper and deeper. Eventualy we had to walk through 1 meter 
                        of snow.. at first it was very fun to walk through it but it felt like there was no end to it. So after some people wanted to stay 
                        at a spot we went ahead just a little bit and stopped because we came across a person who was descending. A belgian guy he told us
                        there was not so much up ahead and that it was very hard to go onwards. So we decided to stop the expidition and go back.

                        Everyone was drenched till their knees because of the snow, so we decided to change and going for a Fika!

                        We dediced to go to the Espresso bar for the Fika, because everything else was closed. 
                        On the way to the bar Mia joined our party and later on the belgium guy!

                        We missed the bus so we had to walk around 30 minutes to the centrum. Arriving at the cafe
                        I could smell the fragrance of coffee beans, but I ordered a hot choclat and I asked for a typical swedish
                        pastery and the barista suggested the Semmelsnäcka(tasted like some cake, with some sweet insides and a lot of cream).
                        It was really "gezellig" and we had socialized a lot and also with the belgium guy! 
                        Alessio also pointed out to the good to be go bag at the counter, good to be go is an application where you can buy
                        the leftovers of companies which are going to be thrown away. Mia bought one so we had to wait till 18:45 to pick it up.
                        After picking up and getting dissapointed we went home. The contents of the bag was a big sandwhich and 2 kinds of cake.
                        Only for 49SEK instead of 149SEK. We had a laugh and we said our goodbyes for tonight.

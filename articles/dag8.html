                        Woke up with a hangover because I didn't drank any water before sleeping Yesterday, smart of me.. 
                        preparing to go to school there was one portion of the salmon pasta left and I eated it, I was so happy that there was some food in the fridge.
                        And I also took a shower that helped a bit.

                        On our way to school~ with Annabel, Annika and Alvaro. Girls are gossiping while the guys were walking.
                        <!--*Gossip* So Annika was talking to a swedish boy from Stockholm at the party Yesterday (She went with other international people to the party) and the swedish boy asked for her instagram and he couldn't find it so he asked for her number,
                        so she gave it to him but she found it very strange because later he followed her on instagram. So he sent a big text message saying: that he would be her suggardaddy, he would pay her €700 a month so he could buy her things and etc. and 
                        yes she blocked him and was startled. *Gossip ends*!--> then we talked about what kind of games we could play, and talked about hobbys etc. Annabel and Annika may not be going to Lapland (26.2 - 4.3 organised by the study union) because they find it
                        too expensive, it's a six day trip with the bus including accomidation for €366, and for activities you had to pay seperate e.g. <a href="https://www.timetravels.com/student-trips/sweden/student-unions-sweden/sundsvall.html">check it out for yourself</a>.

                        <h3>What is?</h3>
                        <p>Location scouting is a vital component in the pre-production stage of filmmaking and commercial photography. 

                            Once producers or directors decide a scene outside of the studio is needed, the search for a stuiable place or “location” begins.
                            
                            Location scouts eek out spectacular or intersting locations beforehand, to have a database of locations in case of requests:
                            
                            <a href="Locamundo.com/en">Locamundo.com/en</a> location scout website (exclusive to location scouts)
                        </p>
                        <h3>How to scout</h3>
                        <p>A location scout tpically takes discriptive, a panoramic photography or video of locatino possibilities. 

                            A good location scout will make photos of a location possibility that teflect the aesthetic goals of the prodictopm
                            
                            Include visually descriptive photography and information to present, documenting more than what will potentially appear onscreen.
                            (What’s on the other side of the wall, where can you put your equipment?)
                            
                            A scout als has to consider practical information. Does your location have easy access? Parking? Noise? Bathrooms? Food ? Power? … (what’s the escape route for the location incase of a fire, is there food nearby? Is there enough power? Where is the nearest area to plug in ?)
                            
                            Is there a suitable holding are for talent and crew? 
                            (room space corner, for a temp offfice, eg. people working with laptop he needs to work in silent, make up artist in their own environment)
                            
                            Whilst scouting find contact information. Who owns the property? Photograph clues for when you need to secure permissions later. 
                            (Park outside, related to the people living there?, License plate number you can freely find out who the owner of the car is, providing you with information, you can easily trackdown people)
                            
                            MAke sure you are collecting Geo Data either embedded in your images or using a map application. 
                            (Use your phone to make a photo for geo data, because not all dslr’s have the option) (How’s the light working?, where’s the light coming from? usually you don;t want sun coming from)
                        </p>
                        <h3>Wat do you need for scouting?</h3>
                        <p>A scout would carry a camera (HR), weather protection, Extra memory, Extra battery, Extra camera, Compass(your phone), Tape measure and tripod. 

                            A camera (High resolution) doesn’t have to be an expensive camera. Your phone is probably enough. The ability to change lensen is a bonus however. (good wide angle lensen)
                            
                            Weather protection: Keep you and your camera dry. Wrap up warm… Layers, layers, layers.
                            (Never to cold, never to hot, you only got the wrong clothes).
                            
                            Memory cards come in many capacities and speeds. Use what you can afford, carry a spare, format the card with your camera.
                            
                            Extra battery: fully charged before you leave. A power bank is a must if using your phone.
                            
                            Extra camera: hope for the best…. prepare for the worst. 
                            
                            Compass: knowing the sun position in relation your location will help you plan your shoot. 
                            
                            Browser and app version: The photographer’s ephemeris
                            
                            (where’s the moon is coming to be, do you want the light of the moon?)
                            
                            Tape Measuer; a shoot often require space. It’s handy to know basic room measurements.
                            
                            Tripod; will help keep your camera steady and level.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Style</h3>
                            <p>Location scout  photos are often used to inform about a location. (There are all of these disturbance objects, how, who removes them? Do people come regulary to the location to do things?)

                                As a good an overview of a location as possible is necessary. The object is to be descriptive not artistic. Horizontal not vertical.
                                
                                Be sure to capture images that overlap. Look for prominent object thjat are easy to identify.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Tools</h3>
                            <p>- Software such as TPE allows you to chart the sun and moon positions.
                                - Apps such as Sun Seeker use AR to visualise sun and moon positions. 
                                - Photopills.com 
                                If you are scouting with your phone and intend to shoot with a professional camera later try a viewfinder app. Magic canonic viewFinder.
                                
                                The viewfinder app enables you to visualise the crop your final shot might have.
                                
                                Google maps can used to build custom maps, you can pin locations and add media, collaborate or share easily.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Caste study I</h3>
                            <p>The music video for The confusions was shot entirely on location scheduling for the video relied on the data gathered during the scout. 
                                (the sun can be used for a good back light, be cautios how much time you have)
                                
                                The availability of light influenced the shooting schedule and informed the equipment list.
                                
                                Confusion - Shooting plan
                                
                                The centrepiece for the video was a performance in the library using the window as a backlight. This required perfect timing and a bit of luck with the weather.
                                
                                Close ups of the musicians used a synthethic light to fake the sun once it had passed the window.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Case study II</h3>
                            <p>The short film The Good Smaaritan,  was shot outdoors. The story demanded a car, stuck in snow on a desolated road. We created a map and went exploring.

                                Apparently forest pretty much looks the same no matter how far you drive. Maria has made up her mind that this location isn’t up to scratch, meanwhile Jonathan has found another tree of interest. The best of the locations we foudn that day didn’t have sufficient resources nearby for a two day shoot in winter conditions. 
                                (parked my own car to how it looked on the shot, there were no places nearby for food, etc.)(So we still had no location)
                                
                                Eeventually our producer suggested a location that ticked all the right boxes Elevation, Isolation, Photogenic and facilities nearby.
                                
                                Once a location was found a storyboard was made that fit the location. Because our collective drwawing skills were rubbish I revisted the location with Henrik (the first AC) to previsualise.
                                
                                Revisting the location enabled us to figure out camera positions and lenses. (A map of camera’s with numbers, part of the script. Take a drone up their to take a photo of that. The material we shot allowed us to visualise the look and feel of the film.
                            </p>

                            <h3>summary</h3>
                            <p> - Scouting is surveying and documenting
                                - Scouting photography is informative, not artistic.
                                - Be prepared iwth the right equipment, have a plan B.
                                - Shoot horizontal, shoot form the hip.
                                - Keep in mind the practical needs of crew such as food and water.
                                - Use apps to log, capture and plan ahead.
                                - Consider lighting problems and workarounds.

                    <p>
                      Classes finished earlier than expected(scheduled 15:00) so I went to take a shit first and after that I went to Birsta City. To buy a HDMI cable (because I got a computer monitor for free and Shoes for the gym and summer, and maaaybe a headlamp for when traveling in the dark e.g. photographing the northen lights).
                      I went to birsta city, bought a HDMI cable at mediamarkt for 79 SEK and a Lemon caffeine drink it's like lemonade with caffeine how awesome is that. I went looking for shoes at the Stadium and wanted to buy the classic vans, the didn't had my size their biggest was 43, so they sent me to Jeansbolaget Sundsvall and their
                      biggest size was 42 so they sent me to the skateboard shop in Sundsvall center called Slappy curb skate shop, they also didn't had the size the shopkeeper told me that their was one guy who bought 4 pairs because he had to travel from far. So I had to choose a different model and choose a newer version of vans with Brown and 
                      black colors. The pair of shoes costed me €88 they are comfy and very nice to wear, he also told me that you're able to do wintersport in the evening so Monday to Friday it's open from 5 PM to 9 PM and on weekends only till 5 PM.
                      We are also able to borrow free wintersport equipment from a store called Fritids banken. After getting my shoes I asked the shopclerk where I can find a store to buy a headlamps. So he suggested me to go to Naturkompaniet Sundsvall, and yes I found a headlamp from the brand Blackdiamond it's rechargeable and has 3 colors, red, green, blue and white 
                      550 lumen and can shine 7 hours on maximum stand. IT costed me €70 tho..

                      After buying the things, I also went to the ICA to buy some zucchini and Aubergine for diner. Went home and ate diner same as last monday. 
                      Chicken, zucchini and aubergine. Later on I arrived at 20:00 at the gym, today I trained chest, triceps, back, underback, and a little bit legs.
                      I met Jonas and Timo later on, had some chit chat and afterwards went home.

                        After waking up I felt very tired because of Yesterday whole body is aching because of all the exercise.
                        People were going to the Ikea and having a Fika in town but I sadly had to decline because I still had to do some homework.
                        But before homework, cleaning the house with Abdirahman (my housemate). I cleaned the kitchen and bathroom he cleaned the floor and the toilet.
                        After I finish I started to making my homework and writing this blog, also Jonas W. came by and gave my long lost poster :)
                        . So today was kinda relaxing and I had some hamburgers.

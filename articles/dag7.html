                        Waking up at 11:00 AM to enjoy a productive day at home. Reading the book: Studio everywhere A Photographer's Guide to Shooting in Unconventional Locations by Nick Fancher.
                        After reading the introduction and part I, I conclude till now this book is full with case studies, he tells about his photography experience in difficult environments/ locations E.g. small appartments with children etc.
                        It is nice to read the experience he had but I also loved that he talked about the rules for portaits instead of deeping right in to it. He also gives advice about, just go and see what you can shoot don't plan, and how to make
                        someone less worried by "doing as if" having a plan. So till now I find it kinda bullshit.

                        I noticed that the police were patrolling the area a lot, this one was e.g. standing still for 30min with it's lights on (spoiler: Later on the day there were more busses and cars patrolling our area Nacksta and we met the same officer 3 times because 
                        we talked with her. I also asked my housemate he's swedish why there are so many police patrolling he said that it maybe has to do with the terrorist attack in Stockholm so the police are patrolling the areas more.)

                        We (Alessio, Alvaro, Anna, Eelco, Wikki, Ricardo, Mia, Óscar, Marie, Claudia and me) arrived arround 8:20 PM at Hannah's place for the pre party we were delayed because the bus was delayed, Who's Hannah you're wondering. Hannah is a classmate of Wikki she's Swedish and a first year Graphic design student,
                        Wikke is also studying Graphic design for an exchange at Mittuniversitetet, so that's how they know each other. When we arrived they already started drinking, it was nice to see freshman haha.
                        We played drinking games <a href="https://mdsu.se/en/student-life/">Gas gas</a> our first time playing it was very fun because everyone could join and everyone is focused because you could get fucked.

                        After this game ended with beer pong (I was in a team with Marie, Wikke and 2 Swedish people 1 was the friend of Hannah) until 23:00 and then we went to the party!

                        Arriving at the party, we met up with the international student commite Rebecca Larsen en Liz Oskarsson. After meeting them we wanted to play ping pong and there was a Korean guy watching
                        he was like I bet you're very good at this, and I was like no I'm shit and I'll demonstrate it to you right now! So after demonstrating we had a laugh en had a conversation. He's called Kim Jinsoo, 26 years old and 
                        he quit school and works right now in a bar earning around €3000,- each month. So he's enjoying life, how he got in? Everyone get's in without showing anything so yh. But he was also with a girl his "Sugarmommy" he get's a lot of stuff
                        from her like luxury clothes and she pays all the drinks everytime because he told me that she earns my salary in half a day, crazy. After talking about common things. So he got me free drinks! very nice because it's also very expensive :').

                        Today I woke up super early to assist Mia for her photo shoot in Fagerdalsparken. We woke up early to 
                        see the sunrise but it was super cloudy so we couldn't see shit. While shooting I was freezing because I 
                        was standing still a lot of the times.

                        and that was it for today!

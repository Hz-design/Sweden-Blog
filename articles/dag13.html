                                <h4>Human vision</h4>
                                <p>Lens is like the human eye, outer layer bends light and the retina will receive it.
                                    Two Eyes = Three dimensions (3D). Each eye captures its own view and the two separate images are sent on to the brain for processing. Humans see in 3 dimensions.
                                    
                                    The Dominant eye, is the one your brain prefers when it comes to processing visual input.
                                    
                                    Models, want to face the camera with their dominant eye.
                                    
                                    An often quoted focal length of the eye is 17mm (Optometric diopter value). A more accepted value is 22mm to 24mm (physical refraction in the eye). (actual world view length is 50mm).
                                    
                                    The focal length tells us the angle of the view (how much of the scnee will be capttured) and the maginification (how large individual elements will be).
                                    
                                    The focal length is an indicator of the distance from the subject: The images are all framed the same’ differences arise because the focal length is getting longer (zooming in_ as the camera mpves further away from the subject.The longer the focal length the bigger the background gets and it gets softer (more bokeh)(shallow depth of field).
                                    
                                    Image stabilisation should be turned off if camera is on tripod.
                                    Af (active focus) Works by shooting a red beam on your subject which bounces lgiht back to your camera.
                                    
                                    
                                    Passive AF mainly works by detecting contrast in the scene. It tends to lock focus on the spot closest to the camera where maximum contrast is found.
                                    
                                    Modern cameras have focus points. A focus pointn is simply a point at which the camera can focus. A popular technique is to use centre AF point, hold button halfway and reframe.Manual Focus (MF)  use Magnify focus, or Focus peaking to assure sharpness.
                                    
                                    Standard/Normal lenses 
                                    In photography and cinemantography, a normal lens is a lens that reproduces a field of view that appears “natural” to a human observer.
                                    
                                    A wide-angle has a shorter focal length when compared to a standard lens. This enables you to capture.a comparative wider angle of view. A wide-angle lens is a natural choice for capturing nature landscape.
                                    
                                    Telephoto lens can provicde you with a narrow field of view. These long lenses enables you to compress a distance, and compress the sense of depth, as well and pick ouy specific object from far off.
                                    
                                    Fisheye lens is a wide-angle that provides extremely wide images by chaging straight lines into curves. It can sometimes produce circular, convex, or oval images by distorting the perspective and creating a 180 degree image.
                                    
                                    Macro lenses are used for close up or macro photography. These lensesn abotain razor sharp focus for subjects within the macro focus distances, but lose their ability for sharp focus at other distances.
                                    
                                    Tilt-shift lenses enables you to manipulate the vanishing points, so when you’re shooting buildings you can alter the perspective of an image so the pararell lines don;t convervege thus distorting the world of view.
                                    
                                    Full frame refers to a sensor size with the same dimensions as the 35mm film. Refers to the size of the imaging sensor inside a camera.

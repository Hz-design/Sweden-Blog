                                        <p>In the visual arts, composition is the placement or arrangtment of visual elements or “ingredients” in a work of art, as disting from the subject.

                                            The term compositions means putting together and can apply to any work</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Space</h4>
                                        <p>Space, or Depth, refers to the area that a shape or form occupies. Space itself can be defined as positive or negative. </p>
                                        <p>Positive space is the filled space, the obejects or elements in the design, i.e. foreground. Extreme positive space occurs when the image is without a clear background.</p>
                                        <p>Negative space is the area between deisng elements or objecects, i.e. background. When used properly, negative space provides a natural balance against the positive space in a scene.</p>
                                        <p>When positive and negative space intersect it can lead to bad composition.</p>
                                        <p>space</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Equal division of space results in visual boredom.</li>
                                            <li>Spaces unrelated because of too great a contrast in area.</li>
                                            <li>Near enough in space areas to be pleasantly related.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Equal space divison around the spot becomes monotonous. (center spaced)
                                            The spot places here creates an emptiness in the rest of the pictures. (left upper corner space)
                                            spot on the on thirds line better aesthetlically.
                                            conslusion: identify your subject and consciously place it.</p>

                                        <h4>Rule of Thirds</h4>
                                        <p>The rule of thirds is a simplified version of the golden mean which describes the perfectly symmetrical relationship between two porportions.</p>
                                        <p>Approximately equal to a 1:1.61 ratio.

                                        <p>Dumbed down version is the rule of thirds.
                                            Placing the subject at the intersecting points.
                                            Steve mccurry, book about composition in the library.</p>
                                        <p>According to the rule, placing your subjecti n the entre is undersirable. PLacing the subject whree the lines intersect improves the overall.</p>
                                        <p>Instead of placing horizons in the centre of the image, align them with the horizontal lines.</p>
                                        <p>Using the rule of thirds you can utilise the balance of your image.</p>

                                        <h4>Fill The Frame</h4>
                                        <p>This only nothing else.
                                            Fill the frame means to get in close, to make your subject a significant portion of the final photograph. Fill the frame encourages you, as a photographer, to think about your subject and how best to feature that subject in your photograph.</p>
                                        <p>How can you bring forward the details or the patters or the most cirical elemtns of your subject. How does the background add to or take away from the story that you are trying to tell?</p>
                                        <p>Filling the frame can help avoid “univited guests”.</p>

                                        <h4>Horizontal vs Vertical</h4>
                                        <p>Horizontal subjects, objects, lines, shapes, forms tend to give a feeling of stability and calmness to the viewer. Vertical objects are preceived strong becasue they stand against the gravitation force.</p>
                                        <p>The “rules” around when to compose a photograph with a vertical layout versus a horzintal layour center around the composition of the subject itself.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Framing</h4>
                                        <p>Frames around the edge of the composition help to isolate the subject. Using a frame withing a frame is a way to lead your viewers eyes in to a photo this can add depth and context, plus draw attention to a defined point.</p>
                                        <p>A natural frame can be a doorway, archway, branches of a tree etc. Natural frames will isolate your subject from the rest of the image and lead the eye.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Balance and Symmetry</h4>
                                        <p>Placing your main subject off-centre, as with the rule of thirds, creates a mnore intersting photo, but it can leave a void in the scene which can make it feel empty. </p>
                                        <p>Visual balance brings a certain stability and harmony to an image whereas, in certain casem an unbalaced composition can make an image feel dynnamic and energetic.</p>
                                        <p>in art, balance is dependent on the size and number of objects within a scene. The perfect of balance is symmetry where one half top/bottom, left/rightm diagonal/split of an image is identical.</p>
                                        <p>Misalignment can be distracting in an image, stand precisely at a centre point and keep the camera perpendicular to the subject.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h4>Bonus Rules</h4>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>The rule of space involves creating negative space that directly relates to your subjet in some way.</li>
                                            <li>If a subject that is moving you should place more space infront of it than behind it. </li>
                                            <li>The rule of direction is to leave room in the direction of your subject's eyes.</li>
                                            <li>The rule of odds stated that framing your subject with 2 surroundings objects (this creating an odd number of 3) suggest balance and harmony visually.</li>
                                            <li>Visual rhythms occur through repitition. Sometimes there’s symmertry to tis repetition and sometimes obejcts can be syncopated against other like summetrical objects.</li>
                                            <li>By using colour creatively, we can lead the viewer’s eye to the subject, create harmony or establish mood.</li>
                                            <li>A leading line paves an easy path for the eye to follow through different elements of a photo.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                            Though it’s important to learn compositional rules, it’s perhaps even more important to learn when to break them. </p>

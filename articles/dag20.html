                        Today I started the day off with a pecan pie and some milk, followed by some vitamin C+D. 
                        As usual we got together as a group and went to school!

                                        It needs to have a strong constrast with its surroundings

Shape could also be seen as silhouettes

                                    <p>Smooth, rough, hard, soft, woven, bumpy/lumpy, jagged/irregular, riged.
                                        The challenge is light how to capture a lot of texture,
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        How to prevent “radioactive/glowing ears”, put gaffer tape behind their ears.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        texture can be accentuated by the side light of the early sunny mornings or early evenings…
Midday will flatten out the lightning of the object.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Or by overhead light when the sun is vertical and high in the sky.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Texture can be used as a background it can create an exciting and emotion filled composition.
Pattern is repititio. Two techniques come into practice while working with pattersn, yuo can emphasise the pattern, or you can break it.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Empahsising</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Emphasising a pattern can accentuate a sense of size and expansion. The idea is too zoom in onto the pattern and fill the frame with it.
(infinete it goes forever.)

                                    <h4>Breaking</h4>
                                    <p>a pattern is all about finding an object that disrupts the continuos flow of a pattern</p>
                                </li>

                                            On location you will be faced with whatever light you have.</p>

                                        <h4>Ambient Light</h4>
                                        <p>refers to the available light at a location whether natural or synthetic. </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Light source: Artificial light, daylight, projector light. Natural light soures, sun moon, sky greatly impacts the mood and tone of a scene. The time of day, weather conditions all impact the scene.Artificial light sources, streetlights, lamps, and light fixturesn can also the ambient lighting in a scene understanding the color temperature and intensity of artifical light soures can help you create more accurate and appealing images.The direction of light: can greatly impact the mood an dfeel of ann image. Front lighting can create flat, unintersting images, while side lighting can add depth and texture. Backlighting an reate rim light and speartion between the subject and the backgorund, while low-angle lighting can create dramatic shadows.The quality of light: also greatly impact an image. Soft light form an overcast day can create a calm, even light, while harsh light from the sun can create strong shadows and contrast. Diffused light from a cloudy day can create a more even, soft looking feel.</li>
                                            <li>Light Quantity: Concernst how much light is available not enough light can cause a photo to become over or underexposed. Light can be measured in two ways: Reflected or Incident metering. incident light meters read the light that falls upon them, placed at the subject.Reflected light is light that bounces off the subject and is interpreted by your camera.The quantity of reflected light can be visualised using a histogram.Aperature: A large aperture (lower f-number) allows more light to etner the camera and can be used to create shallow depth of field effects. A smaller aperture (higher f-number) allows less light to enter the camera and can be used to create sharper images.ISO: This setting determines the camera's sensitivity to light. A higher ISO can be used to capture more ambient light in low light conditions, but can also introduce noise or graininess into the image.Shutter speed: This setting determines the lenth of time thatthe camera's sensor is exposed to light. A slower shutter speed (longer exposure) can be used to capture more ambient light and crate motion blur effects. A fast shutter speed (shorter exposure) can be used to freeze motion.Your camera should have an exposure level indicator.</li>
                                            <li>Light quality: How do we control the camera, to create wanted outcomes. Dramatically affects appearance . Quality usually concerns whether the light is direct (hard) or filtered (soft). Avoid problems like racoon eyes if neccesarry, but use it if it's fits the theme/story. Hard light: Highly directional, creates strong shadows and high contrast, good for drama but challenging to work with. Soft light: Less directional, creates softer shadows, ideal for portraits, less defined shadows.Shadow quality: Shadows can impact mood and atmosphere, soft shadows are less defined, while hard shadows are more difined.Color temperature: Color temperature can impact mood and atmosphere, warm light is inviting, cool light is sterile.Soft light is often created when the light source is large and diffused. hard light can be created when the light source is small and direct.</li>
                                            <li>Light modifiers, Reflectors are a cheap and effective way to redistribute available light. Black reflector is negative fill it substracts light. Diffuser it doesn't bounce light but it filters light. Reflector kits often contain a diffsue option. Diffusion filters light. Reflector kits offer affordable and portable light modifying solutions.Polystrene makes for a great DIY alternative for bouncing light.</li>
                                            <li>Light temperture, determines wheterh a photo appears warm of cool and it's measured in Kelvin. Light temperature can be modified using the white balance setting on your camera. Mixing light temperature, such as indoor and outdoor, can have a negative effect. </li>

                        International Committee, Rebecca and Jonas W. were already waiting in the meeting room D017. 
                        Me, Álvaro, Alessio, Alvaro, Anna, Eelco, Marie, Mia and Riccardo arrived together, Niclas was sick 
                        so sadly he couldn't come at the first meeting.

                        Rebecca, briefed us through everything, what the rules are of the committee, what we can organize, what has happend in the past, 
                        about the Lapland trip 26.2 - 04.03 and about the Overalls! The overalls are like outfits that every student has to wear at certain events,
                        you can earn patches and stitch it to your overall and their are certain rules for the overall. You can't wash the overalls only if u wear them so 
                        jumping in a lake, standing underneath a waterfall etc. Every studyfield has it's own colour, the internationals have orange! You can share certain parts 
                        of your overall like sleeves, bottoms with other studyfields it's a mark that you're good friends! You can also 'steal' patches from each other but you can 
                        only use your mouth, you can also switch pockets the front pockets stand for that you had sex with them, the back pockets are for having anal sex with them xD.
